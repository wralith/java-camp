# Week 1

I did not go over all the videos, take a glance on the titles and created few examples on the primitive data types as well as arrays, loops and conditionals. You can reach more information about my approach to homeworks in `Readme` in the [root folder](https://github.com/wralith/java-camp).

#### 01-string-array-basics  
- Basic checks like of string start with `x` or contain `xyz`.

#### 02-fizzbuzz
- You know what fizzbuzz is. ðŸ˜Š

#### 03-find-the-number
- This might be out of the scope of the homework.
- Interactive command line game which player tries to guess randomly generated number.
- Reading from command line, Loops, conditionals, exception etc.
