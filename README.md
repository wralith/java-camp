# Introduction  

## Motivation  

### Learning the OOP approach will be fun!  

Beside fun Java is one of the most used language and most of the programming books are refers OOP and the examples are mostly written in Java -some might be directly pointing problem that java creates but still...-.  

### To use or to learn  

I generally write **Go** and **Typescript**, lastly I have been trying to learn *gRPC* and *protobuf*, which makes it possible to create language agnostic definition that generate codes to implement servers and clients to share the data between services which can also be implemented in different languages. So i decided it would be fun to use different approaches in different parts of my personal projects.

Beside that i decided to learn Java not because of practical usage but *curiosity*.

## üè≥ Criticism  

Bad things first, to be honest first two courses I did not liked it all -wished there was a 3x speed in youtube-! It seems like it was only for beginners, although the emphasis on "finding a place in the sector" made me uncomfortable. However, Introduction to layered structure and dependency injection in third course was good and therefore my first criticism *explodes*... But the emphasis on *"making money"* still disturbing me, to be clear not the instructors statements but the vibe that i felt in chat and comments... The ultimate goal of life might be fame and fortune for modern individual but the education is about knowledge and knowledge is about passion, not money, I do not like places where the major motivation is directly money -since it found itself a place anyhow-...  

## üñäÔ∏è My Method on Following Course  

### Exercises and Homeworks  

I will do the ones that seems important to me; sometimes ignore, sometimes mix homeworks to each others and sometimes use the implementations outside of their context on additional exercises if I can come up with some. The objective of the exercises for me is -and always been- 'learning' instead of fulfilling the class requirements.   

### Notes  

I will create additional folder for my notes when the advanced topics comes up, i do actually curious about concurrency in Java for example but I am not sure if it is in the course plan.  

### Folder Structure  

I am not sure about folder structure and other things so the repo will shape itself in time hopefully. Not sure about `.gitignore` file as well...
